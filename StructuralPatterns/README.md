# Structural Design Patterns (Java)

## 📌 Overview

**Structural Design Patterns** focus on how **classes and objects are composed** to form **larger, flexible, and efficient structures**.
Rather than concentrating on object creation or behavior, these patterns emphasize **relationships, composition, and structure**.

Structural patterns help ensure that changes in one part of the system **do not ripple through the entire codebase**, making systems **robust, scalable, and easy to maintain**.

---

## 🎯 Why Structural Patterns?

Structural patterns are used when:

* You want to **simplify complex object structures**
* You need to **adapt incompatible interfaces**
* You want to **add functionality without modifying existing code**
* You need to **decouple abstractions from implementations**
* You want to **optimize memory usage** for large numbers of objects

They improve:

* Flexibility
* Maintainability
* Reusability
* System scalability
* Code readability

---

## 🧠 Core Principles Used

Structural patterns strongly rely on:

* **Composition over inheritance**
* **Loose coupling**
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## 🧩 Common Structural Design Patterns

| Pattern Name  | Purpose                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Convert one interface into another                    |
| **Bridge**    | Decouple abstraction from implementation              |
| **Composite** | Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly   |
| **Decorator** | Add behavior dynamically                              |
| **Facade**    | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem |
| **Flyweight** | Reduce memory usage by sharing objects                |
| **Proxy**     | Control access to another object                      |

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AdapterPattern/`   | Implements the Adapter Pattern to make incompatible interfaces work together |
| `BridgePattern/`    | Implements the Bridge Pattern to separate abstraction from implementation    |
| `CompositePattern/` | Implements the Composite Pattern to treat objects and compositions uniformly |
| `DecoratorPattern/` | Implements the Decorator Pattern to add responsibilities dynamically         |
| `FacadePattern/`    | Implements the Facade Pattern to simplify complex subsystems                 |
| `FlyweightPattern/` | Implements the Flyweight Pattern to optimize memory usage                    |
| `ProxyPattern/`     | Implements the Proxy Pattern to control access to objects                    |

Each pattern is implemented in its **own package** with:

* Clear interfaces or abstract classes
* Concrete implementations
* A client/demo class
* Inline comments and explanations
