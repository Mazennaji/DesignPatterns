# Design Patterns

A complete collection of Java design pattern examples. Each folder contains working code, explanations, and README for understanding structure, roles, and real-world applications.

## 🎯 What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are proven templates that provide a structured approach to solving design challenges, making code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

Design patterns are **not** finished code that can be directly copied - they are blueprints or best practices that can be adapted to solve specific problems in your application.

### Why are Design Patterns Important?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Code Reusability** | Apply tested solutions across different projects |
| **Improved Communication** | Provide a common vocabulary for developers |
| **Maintainability** | Create organized, structured code that's easier to modify |
| **Scalability** | Build flexible systems that adapt to changing requirements |
| **Best Practices** | Learn from collective experience of expert developers |
| **Faster Development** | Avoid reinventing the wheel for common problems |
| **Reduced Errors** | Use proven solutions that have been tested in production |

### The Gang of Four (GoF)

The 23 classic design patterns were introduced by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in their 1994 book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software." These patterns remain fundamental to modern software engineering.

## 📚 Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
Patterns for object creation mechanisms

### Structural Patterns
Patterns for assembling objects and classes into larger structures

### Behavioral Patterns
Patterns for object interaction and responsibility distribution

## 🎨 Creational Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Singleton** | One instance per application |
| **Factory Method** | Interface for object creation |
| **Abstract Factory** | Families of related objects |
| **Builder** | Step-by-step complex object construction |
| **Prototype** | Clone existing objects |

---

## 🏗️ Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Adapter** | Interface compatibility wrapper |
| **Bridge** | Separate abstraction from implementation |
| **Composite** | Tree structure for part-whole hierarchies |
| **Decorator** | Add responsibilities dynamically |
| **Facade** | Simplified interface to complex system |
| **Flyweight** | Share data to support many objects |
| **Proxy** | Surrogate for access control |

---

## 🔄 Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass requests along handler chain |
| **Command** | Encapsulate requests as objects |
| **Iterator** | Sequential access to collection |
| **Mediator** | Centralized communication |
| **Memento** | Capture and restore object state |
| **Observer** | One-to-many state change notifications |
| **State** | Behavior changes with internal state |
| **Strategy** | Family of interchangeable algorithms |
| **Template Method** | Algorithm skeleton with customizable steps |
| **Visitor** | Separate algorithms from object structure |
