# Creational Design Patterns (Java)

## 📌 Overview

**Creational Design Patterns** focus on **how objects are created**, abstracting and controlling the instantiation process.
Instead of creating objects directly using constructors, these patterns provide **flexible, reusable, and controlled object creation mechanisms**.

Creational patterns help make systems **independent of how objects are created, composed, and represented**, which is especially important in large-scale and evolving software systems.

---

## 🎯 Why Creational Patterns?

Creational patterns are used when:

* Object creation logic is **complex or repetitive**
* You want to **decouple object creation from usage**
* You need to **control the number of instances**
* You want to **hide concrete classes from clients**
* Object creation must be **configurable or extensible**

They improve:

* Flexibility
* Reusability
* Testability
* Maintainability
* System scalability

---

## 🧠 Core Principles Used

Creational patterns are built upon:

* **Encapsulation of object creation**
* **Separation of concerns**
* **Loose coupling**
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## 🧩 Common Creational Design Patterns

| Pattern Name         | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**        | Ensure a single instance of a class          |
| **Factory Method**   | Delegate object creation to subclasses       |
| **Abstract Factory** | Create families of related objects           |
| **Builder**          | Construct complex objects step by step       |
| **Prototype**        | Create objects by cloning existing instances |

Each pattern is implemented in its **own package** with:

* Interfaces or abstract classes
* Concrete implementations
* A client/demo class
* Clear inline documentation
