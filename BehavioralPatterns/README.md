# Behavioral Design Patterns (Java)

## 📌 Overview
**Behavioral Design Patterns** focus on how objects **communicate, interact, and share responsibilities**.  
Rather than concentrating on object creation or structure, these patterns emphasize **behavior, control flow, and responsibility delegation** between objects.

Behavioral patterns help make systems **flexible, loosely coupled, and easy to extend**, especially when the way objects interact is likely to change.

---

## 🎯 Why Behavioral Patterns?
Behavioral patterns are used when:
- You want to **decouple senders and receivers**
- You need to **change behavior at runtime**
- You want to **avoid complex conditional logic**
- You need to manage **object collaboration cleanly**

They improve:
- Maintainability
- Reusability
- Testability
- Scalability of object-oriented systems

---

## 🧠 Core Principles Used
Behavioral patterns are heavily based on:
- **Encapsulation of behavior**
- **Composition over inheritance**
- **Loose coupling**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

## 🧩 Common Behavioral Design Patterns

| Pattern Name | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|
| **Strategy** | Select an algorithm at runtime |
| **Observer** | Notify multiple objects of state changes |
| **Command** | Encapsulate requests as objects |
| **Iterator** | Access collection elements sequentially |
| **State** | Change behavior based on internal state |
| **Template Method** | Define algorithm steps in a base class |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass requests along a chain |
| **Mediator** | Centralize complex communication |
| **Memento** | Capture and restore object state |
| **Visitor** | Add operations without modifying classes |
| **Interpreter** | Define grammar and interpret expressions |
